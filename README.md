# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
For this assignment, three deliverables were completed:
- In Weather_Database, a list of cities with weather information for each was created by generating a set of random latitutes and logitudes, retrieving the nearest cities, and performing an API call with OpenWeatherMap.
- In Vacation_Search, input statements were used to retrieve weather preferences. Using generated preferences, nearby hotels were added to the list of cities and those destinations were put on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
- In Vacation_Itenerary, a Google Directions API was used to create a travel itenerary showing the route between four cities from the customer's possible travel destinations. A marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each of the cities was also created.
